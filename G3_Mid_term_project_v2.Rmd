# The Pandemic and the Unemployment Insurance
![](C:\Users\apmej\OneDrive\Escritorio\R\UI_image.jpeg)

## The beginning

In March 2020 the direction of the country began to change. The COVID-19 Pandemic raged through the country and lockdowns began. The result of this was a near standstill of the economy. As consumer demand decreased and businesses shut down, labor markets began to feel the heat. The combination of economic impacts and an increase in workplace hazards resulted in a massive spike in the unemployment rate. The national rate reached a previously unseen level of 14.7 percent in April 2020. In response to this, Congress passed the CARES Act which contained provisions for enhanced and extended unemployment insurance benefits. While necessary for many to keep afloat during the economic crisis, a potential drawback of this policy is that workers may be disincentivized to work. If the benefit level is sufficiently high, returning to work may pay less money than remaining on unemployment insurance. A rational actor would see this and decide to stay on unemployment insurance and not return to the workforce.
  
 ![](C:\Users\apmej\OneDrive\Escritorio\R\Unemployment.jpeg)

At the early stages of this project, we explored the Department of Labor database on unemployment insurance. This led us to our initial question, which focused on what population segments and industries had a higher number of people disincentivezed from returning to work due to unemployment insurance benefits. This analysis would have been centered around two major economic events, the previously mentioned COVID-19 pandemic and the 2008 financisl crisis. Examining both of these events would have provided the opportunity to compare the two events and see if there were unique circumstances surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. However, after reviewing additional data sources that contained more granular data, we were able to narrow our analysis down to the following question:

**Through analysis of weekly data, which population segment of the United States of America had more individuals disincentivized to return to work due to the enhanced unemployment insurance benefits passed into law in response to the COVID-19 pandemic? **

## Why Pooled Cross section data is relevant?

Pooled cross sections are obtained by collecting random samples from a large population independently and at different points in time. Having random samples collected independently implies that they need not be equal size and will usually contain different statistical units at different points in time. This limits serial correlation of residuals when regression analysis is applied. The later is useful for a variety of purposes, including policy analysis. For example, to study the effects of an unexpected change in unemployment insurance benefits, we can choose the treatment group to be unemployed individuals from a state with a change in unemployment insurance benefits, while the control group could be unemployed workers from a neighboring state. Since each observation is independent, the regression model of pooled cross section is as follows:

## About the data

Starting in April 2020, the U.S. Census Bureau, in collaboration with multiple federal agencies, conducted the Household Pulse Survey (HPS). The main purpose of the survey was to quickly and efficiently collect data that measures household experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The survey was meant to take twenty minutes 20-minute and be completed online. The goal was to be able to assess how individuals, families, and communities are being affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants are drawn from randomly selected addresses and respondents may be asked to complete the survey up to three times to track the effect of the pandemic on households over time. The survey collects data from an average of around 97,000 respondents per week. The survey continues measuring how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting households across the US from a social and economic perspective. A set number of phases were planned and results for Phase 1 were released weekly, and results from Phases 2 and 3 were released every two weeks. The details of each data collection is as follows:

*	Data collection for Phase 1 of the Household Pulse Survey began on April 23, 2020 and ended on July 21, 2020.
*	Data collection for Phase 2 of the Household Pulse Survey began on August 19, 2020 and ended October 26, 2020.
*	Data collection for Phase 3 of the Household Pulse Survey began on October 28, 2020 and ended March 29, 2021.
*	Data collection for Phase 3.1 of the Household Pulse Survey began on April 14, 2021 and ended on July 5, 2021. 
*	Data collection for Phase 3.2 of the Household Pulse Survey began July 21, 2021 and ended on October 11, 2021.
*	Data collection for Phase 3.3 of the Household Pulse Survey began December 1, 2021 and ended on February 7, 2022.
*	Data collection for Phase 3.4 of the Household Pulse Survey started on March 2, 2022 and ended on May 9, 2022. 
*	Data collection for Phase 3.5 of the Household Pulse Survey started on June 1, 2022 and ended on August 8, 2022. 
*	Data collection for Phase 3.6 of the Household Pulse Survey started on September 14, 2022 and is scheduled to continue until November 14, 2022. Phase 3.6 will continue with a two-weeks on, two-weeks off collection and dissemination approach, with data releases scheduled for October 5, October 26, and November 23, 2022.

The details for the dataset can be found in the following link:
https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/household-pulse-survey/datasets.html. 

A complementary dataset we also analyzed and incorporated. This data set contains values for unemployment insurance replacement rates from the US Department of Labor. It is available in the following link: https://oui.doleta.gov/unemploy/ui_replacement_rates.asp

The replacement rate is the ratio of the claimants' weekly benefit amount (WBA) to the claimants' average weekly wage. Two key Replacement Ratios are available:

*	Replacement Ratio 1 = Weighted Average of: WBA / (Normal Hourly Wage x 40 Hrs.)
*	Replacement Ratio 2 = Ratio of:Weighted Average WBA / Weighted Average (Normal Hourly Wage x 40 Hrs.)

## Reasons for using this dataset

The HPS provides many advantages in comparison to other datasets that measure unemployment insurance data (i.e: the unemployment insurance data from the Department of Labor). We list some of the advantages here:

* The high frequency of the data which allows us to measure employment more carefully.
* The large sample size creates a data set that more accurately reflects the reality of the population.
* The information asked allows us to understand socio-economic and geographical differences.

Some of the initial variables we are using from the dataset include:

* State
* Sex
* Educational attainment
* Whether the person was working in the previous week
* Hispanic origin
* Race
* Whether someone in one's household experienced job loss in March 2020 or later
* Whether a person was working in the previous week
* Home ownership and rental information
* Income category
* Unemployment benefit received

Additionally, using the average replacement ratio will allow to further understand the motivation of workers' decisions to return to the labor market, given that with only the unemployment insurance benefits, they could not be able to truly alleviate severe economic hardship, particularly for low-wage workers. 

We would now initiate our Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in the following section, considering that our previously stated research question is:

* **Specific**: It provides the variables that will be evaluated, the periodicity, and scale at the state level.
* **Measurable** The question will allow us to quantify the impacts 
* **Achievable** It can be achieve in a relative short period of time (~2 months) and the necessary data is available
* **Relevant** Extremely relevant given that it can provide key information for policy makers and reduce population vulnerability
* **Time-oriented** Given that it is focus in a short data frame the results should be ready by November 14

```

Evaluating the cross sectional panel, we were able to see that the panel is balanced and has more than 3 million observations. The sample size was reduced when we eliminated people with incomes higher than $150,000 and who did not lose employment. This was done because that population is not likely to be vulnerable to the effects of the pandemic.This reduced the sample size to close to 300,000 observations. As previously mentioned, most people in our sample were not interviewed more than three times. Given that the characteristic of cross- sectional data solves the normality problem, rather than focusing on doing normality tests of the data, we focus on understanding the data further and understanding the linkages that seem to be present between variables. Taking a careful look at our data set is relevant so we can better understand the best approach for a regression analysis. The following section highlights some of the key plots.

## What can we see from our data? 

### Findings between sex and state
```{r, results='asis'}


theme_set(theme_classic())
ss <- ggplot(df_panel2, aes(x=fct_infreq(State)))
ss + geom_bar(aes(fill=Sex), width = 0.7) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=65, vjust=0.6)) + 
  labs(title="Sample per sex and state", 
       subtitle="Number of persons",
       x= 'States',
       y= 'Frequency')


```

For our first data visualization, we present our sample broken out by state. Because this is a raw count, the ranking of how many from each state are included in our sample track fairly closely to how the states rank in population. California, Texas, and Florida are the most represented states in our sample; they are also the three most populous states in the country. South Dakota and North Dakota are the two least represented states and they also place towards the bottom in state population rankings. Something notable is that Washington state is the fourth most represented state in our sample, but ranks only thirteenth in state population.

We further break out our sample by sex for each state. There is nothing too notable to gather from this though, as the distribution of men and women in our sample is close to 50/50 for each state.


### Findings between age and sex
```{r, results='asis'}
# **Box plot per age and state**


ggplot(aes(x=Sex, y=Age, fill= Sex), data=subset(df_panel2, !is.na(Sex))) + 
   geom_boxplot() +
  stat_summary(fun=mean, geom="point", shape=4)+ 
  labs(title="Box Plot Age/ Sex",
                   x= 'Sex',
                   y= 'Age')+
              theme(legend.position = 'none')

```
The Boxplot above shows the mean age between men and women who took the survey. What s interesting to note here is that the boxplot for the men of the database is skewed left. As we can see the mean is less than the median. Meaning most men are older. In general, most survey takers' ages were in between 40 to 60 years old with no outliers. This is relevant since those who are middle aged do not expect their employment status to be as turbulent. Unlike people in the early stages of their career who can expect job loss, they are established in their lives. Meaning if they recorded job loss, it would be a significant event. 

### Findings between education level and region
```{r, results='asis'}



e1 <- ggplot(data = df_panel2,
            mapping = aes(x = Region, fill = Edu))
e1 + geom_bar(position = "stack",
             mapping = aes(y = ..prop.., group = Edu))+ 
              labs(title="Levels of education of the sample",
                   subtitle= 'by US region',
                   x= 'Education',
                   y= 'Proportion of the sample')


```

The above graph measures the survey takers by their highest education while grouping them by region. There are few important observations from this graph. The first being that most of the survey takers are in the South and the West. This makes sense as most people in the US reside in the South and West. 

What is important to point out about these results is the amount of education people have achieved. For instance, in the South, the leading three levels of education are having some high school education, less than high school education and just high school education respectively. Similarly, in the West, the leading levels of education are having less than high school education, some college education, and a Bachelor's  degree. Then, in the Northeast, we have the highest education. The leading education is a graduate degree, a bachelor's degree, then a high school degree. Lastly, in the Midwest, the highest level of education is an associates degree, followed by high school education, and then some college education. 

Its important to analyze the education levels of the survey takers because those with less education are at higher risks of job loss. As seen in the graph, those who took the survey had an education level at the high school level or below. Especially in the South and West, which is where most survey takers reported being from. While already being at risk of job loss, a shut down would cause a drastic increase of job loss for the survey takers. 

As we can see, the survey takers are most vulnerable and likely to apply for unemployment during the COVID-19 shut down. Therefore, they would be valuable to observe throughout time to see the effects of unemployment insurance on employment.

The graph above breaks down the percent of unemployment insurance receipt throughout the weeks of the Pandemic Insurance assistance. Each dot represents the percent of people in the survey for each state that received unemployment. 

Our data begins to capture unemployment insurance being received at week 13. This is likely due to the surge of unemployment claims in the early pandemic causing delays, (U.S.GAO, 2022). 

Another note is the fact that weeks 34 to 39 are missing values. This is due to the fact that, to run the graph, the data removed all nulls. After some additional checks, we found that these weeks were recorded by the US Government as null. This could be due to various reasons but no reason was listed by the Government. 

Nevertheless, conclusions can still be drawn from the data. For example, the most notable point is that between week 27 and week 28, there was a sharp decline in people receiving unemployment. With such a massive decline, something significant must have happened between those weeks. By looking at the dates, one can begin to research what was happening in peoples lives that would've influenced them to stop receiving unemployment insurance. 

Week 27 covers the days March 17 through March 29 and Week 28 covers April 14 through April 26. These dates are significant because in the beginning of March 29, there was an increase in COVID-19 vaccine eligibility. 

Now it is important to note that the vaccine had been available for certain eligible groups since late December 2020. However, it wasn't until the Spring of 2021 that we saw significant roll out of the vaccine. Looking back at our dates, we see that week 27 ends on March 29th. This is relevant as on March 29th, a quick succession of eligibility expansions began. On March 29th, another phase of essential workers became eligible for the vaccine. Then on April 12, even more essential workers became eligible for the vaccine. Then on April 19, the White House announced that all people age 16 and older are eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine, (U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, 2022). There is also a steady decline after week 40 which was taken after PUA ended. The recording stops in September of this year where recipients are at their lowest since the beginning of the data collection. 

While there is no directly tested correlation, it is notable that the sharp decline happened at the exact dates of the vaccine roll out expansion. With this information, we can make the assumption that the sharp decline in people receiving unemployment was due to the vaccine. It is likely that people were awaiting employment contingent on their vaccine status. As soon as they became eligible for the vaccine, they returned to work. Additionally, ,the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance had been in its extended phase, there was no assurance that it would continue. It is safe to say that the vaccine roll out eliminated a significant health risk for people and coupled with the fact that PUA was ending, people returned to the work force.

##  Pearson's Chi-squared test

test<- chisq.test(table(df_panel2$anywork,df_panel2$UI_recrv),correct=FALSE)
test


```

Given that the main variables in our data set are categorical we used a Chi-Square test to determine if two categorical variables (the main dependent (Employment status for last 7 days) and independent (Unemployment Insurance received)) have a significant correlation between them.

H0: the variables are independent, there is no relationship between the two categorical variables. Knowing the value of one variable does not help to predict the value of the other variable

H1: the variables are dependent, there is a relationship between the two categorical variables. Knowing the value of one variable helps to predict the value of the other variable

We reject the null hypothesis given that the p-value is smaller than 0.05.There is a significant relationship between the employment status for last 7 days and unemployment insurance received. Therefore, knowing the value of one variable helps to predict the value of the other variable.


# Findings and Conclusions

The amount of data we are working with and the frequency of observations allows us to avoid statistical mistakes and obtain a robust regression analysis that could provide relevant insight on unemployment. Having seen how sex and education change through the sample through state and the different percentage of unemployed receiving the benefit, using sex, education, and age as control variables will allow us in the next steps to obtain relevant conclusions that can contribute in informing employment policy in US.


## Additional Information
Additional information that would greatly benefit our analysis is data on all benefits received. It would also be beneficial to add the employment rate during the covid-19 vaccine roll out. It would be useful as it can help us see a clearer picture of the incentives to return to work. 

## Reimagining our Question
Our question is:
Which population segment in the United States of America have seen more population disincentivization to return to work due to the Unemployment Insurance under COVID-19 after evaluating weekly data since 2020?

After our exploratory data analysis, we found that there was a sharp decline in unemployment insurance being received after the dates of the vaccine roll out. Which means we may need to consider that the monetary incentive of the pandemic assistance insurance(PUA) did not outweigh the incentive to return to work. Instead, the incentive to stay on unemployment could be more closely aligned to the health risk associated with returning to work unvaccinated. We will need to reconsider our question to cover the vaccine's effect on unemployment and unemployment insurance. Furthermore, it is not as useful to explore which population experience disincentivization, but rather explore what incentives outweighed each other. In sum, our question should be reframed to see if an incentive was there to begin with. 

From our EDA we can see that the benefits of the pandemic unemployment assistance(PUA) were not as strong as the incentive to return to work. From this analysis we can begin to sketch out an answer to our question. Since the sharp decline in unemployment benefits received happened in April 2021, months before its end in September 2021, we can say people were incentivized to return to work regardless of the PUA benefits.

# Limitations

It is important to mention that although our approach uses data that can represent fairly well the US population under unemployment and receiving unemployment insurance there are still some limitations associated to it:

* The effects of the unemployment insurance cannot be assessed completely;
* The way we are qualifying the incentives to return to the job market, could be bias (i.e: health, monetary, etc);
* Unemployment insurance was not the only incentive that was used during COVID-19 that could descincentivize the return to work (i.e: food stamps, etc);

# Next Steps

Once the data has been more carefully understood the next steps will required to analyze the type of regression analysis that we would need to undertake. Some of the options can included difference in difference regression, fixed and random effects.Dummy variables will also be selected in order to test difference in intercept terms or slope coefficient, allow the intercept to have different values in each period.
